This is the original Mindmap module for moodle formerly found on ekpenso.com. 
This Mindmap module allows you to create and save simple mindmaps from within moodle.

Quick install instructions:

- Copy this "/mindmap"-Folder and place it in your /mod directory
- Go to your admin area and "Notifications"
- That's it

Have fun!
